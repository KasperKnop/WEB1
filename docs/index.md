# Welcome To WEB1

This is the course website for WEB1 - a course that serves as an introduction to front-end web development and core web standards. Students will gain proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while developing the competencies necessary to create responsive, user-friendly, interactive, and dynamic websites.

In the sidebar, you'll find the course sessions, each with their own preparation material and exercises.

The course is structured into 12 sessions, covering 8 topics and 3 hands-on projects. Each session will generally consist of the following:

1. **Preparation**: Before class, you'll go through assigned material - primarily videos, supplemented by selected online readings. Expect to dedicate some time to preparation, as most of the theoretical content is covered in advance.

2. **Recap**: We'll kick things off with a brief but focused review of the most essential concepts.

3. **Exercises**: You'll dive into exercises that reinforce and expand on what you've learned.

4. **Review & Discussion**: We'll go through some of the exercises together and discuss their solutions.

This structure gives you the flexibility to engage with the theory at your own pace before each session, allowing our time together to be dynamic, interactive, and focused on applying what you've learned rather than just passively absorbing information. However, to get the most out of each session, it's essential that you come prepared and actively participate.

## Examination

Individual oral exam, 20 minutes, without preparation.

The student will draw from a pool of known questions and is expected to reference relevant course projects as part of their answer. This involves demonstrating and potentially writing or modifying source code during the exam.

The final grade will be based on an overall assessment of the projects presented and the oral examination.
