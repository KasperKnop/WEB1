# Web Design

In this session, we will explore web design from a developer's perspective. While software engineers are not necessarily expected to become designers, a basic understanding of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design - including the ability to get into the mindset of the user - is essential for anyone involved in creating an interactive software product like a website. Moreover, front-end developers are often required to make design decisions in projects without dedicated designers.

### Web Design Overview

In the video below, we will explore the core principles of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design, showing how thoughtful design decisions - like creating prototypes, planning layouts, and evaluating usability - can improve the way users interact with a website. You will also see how structured approaches, such as design systems and heuristic evaluation, help ensure consistency, clarity, and a better overall user experience.

You can also learn more about heuristic evaluation, by taking a look at this [article on 10 usability heuristics for user interface design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/){:target="\_blank"} by Jakob Nielsen, who also coined the term in the 90s.

### Accessibility

Accessibility is a fundamental part of user experience in web development because it ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively interact with your website. In the video below, we will introduce the fundamentals of web accessibility. You will learn how proper focus management, semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, meaningful link and image text, and thoughtful color and contrast choices all contribute to an inclusive web experience. We will also cover practical testing methods, including using developer tools to simulate visual impairments, running accessibility audits with Lighthouse, and understanding how screen readers interact with web content.
