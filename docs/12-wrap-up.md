# Wrap Up

For the final session, we will go in depth with the exam and review the question sets that you can draw. No preparation is required, but please take a close look at the exam questions file on Itslearning so that we can discuss any questions you might have.

After discussing the exam, I will be available for anyone who needs guidance on the web part of their semester project.

I also hope that some of you will show off the game you created for your third project :smile:

Feel free to share exam questions (or your game) in the comments below!

GOOD LUCK AT THE EXAM :four_leaf_clover:
