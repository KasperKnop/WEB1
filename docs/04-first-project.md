# First Project

## A Personal CV & Portfolio Website :writing_hand_tone2:

For your first project, you will create a personal website that serves as your digital CV and portfolio - something you can continue to use and build upon in your journey towards becoming a software engineer!

---

Your website must include **at least three HTML pages**, each linked together with a consistent **navigation bar**:

1. **Home / About Me**
    - A short introduction including your name, background, and interests.
    - A profile image.
    - Contact information

2. **Curriculum Vitae**
    - A structured overview of your **education**, **work experience**, and optionally **certifications**, **languages**, or **volunteer work**.
    - Use clear sections and formatting to make the content easy to scan.
    - This page should resemble the structure of a traditional CV, but adapted to a web format.

3. **Portfolio**
    - Presentation of at least **three projects**, each including at least:
        - Project name
        - Description
        - Technologies used
        - A link to the project 
        - A project image or screenshot

It is perfectly acceptable to use placeholder images and fictional content if you need more material to build and design your website.

Your website must also meet the following technical requirements:

- ‚úÖ Use **semantic HTML** (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Style the layout using **external CSS** only
- ‚úÖ Use **Grid** and **Flexbox** to construct the layout. Find at least one good use case for each of them.
- ‚úÖ Include at least one **media query** breakpoint.
- ‚úÖ Use **responsive images**.
- ‚úÖ Ensure consistent design and layout across all pages.
- ‚úÖ The layout must be optimized for both mobile phones (‚â§ 480px), tablets (481‚Äì1024px) and desktop (> 1024px).
- ‚ùå No use of JavaScript or any external libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind).
- ‚ùå No **horizontal scrolling** on any pages at any screen size.
- ‚ùå No **absolute paths** (e.g. no links to external images or fonts).

## Tips

- Create a drawing of the layout before you start implementing it.
- It is often easier to start with the mobile layout first (mobile-first design) and only introduce media queries when needed.
