### Basic Responsiveness

You have been hired to make the website for the startup "EcoBottles" more responsive. Using the provided HTML code and [the product banner](https://github.com/KasperKnop/WEB1/blob/main/resources/eco-bottle.png?raw=true){:target="\_blank"}, please address the following issues:

- **Text Width**: The text content currently extends across the entire screen on large displays. Please constrain the text to a maximum width of 1000 pixels.
- **Image Responsiveness**: The product banner image overflows its container on smaller screens, forcing horizontal scrolling. Ensure the image scales down fluidly to fit within the viewport.
- **Mobile Optimization**: The website lacks the proper viewport meta tag, which is essential for ensuring correct scaling and a good user experience on mobile devices. Please add the necessary tag to resolve this.

                <h2>What is EcoBottle?</h2>
                <p>
                    EcoBottle is a new kind of startup dedicated to reducing plastic waste by offering reusable, stylish, and highly durable water bottles. Our
                    mission is simple: make it easier for people everywhere to stay hydrated while making a positive impact on the planet. Each EcoBottle is
                    made from recycled materials, BPA-free, and designed to last for years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether you're an athlete, a student, or simply someone who wants to live more sustainably, EcoBottle is designed to fit seamlessly into
                    your lifestyle. With a range of sizes, colors, and accessories, our bottles are perfect for the office, the gym, or even a hiking trip.
                    Every purchase supports global clean water initiatives, so you're not just buying a bottle-you're contributing to meaningful change.

                <h2>Why Choose EcoBottle?</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional single-use plastic bottles contribute millions of tons of waste to our oceans and landfills each year. By switching to
                    EcoBottle, you're helping cut down on that waste while enjoying a healthier, more convenient alternative. Our bottles are not only
                    environmentally friendly but also engineered for performance, keeping your drinks hot or cold for hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EcoBottle focuses on simplicity and accessibility. You don't need to be an eco-expert to make a difference-just refill your bottle each day.
                    Small habits like this add up to massive positive change for the environment. Plus, we've made sure our bottles are affordable and backed by
                    a lifetime warranty to give you peace of mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond functionality, EcoBottle is also about style and self-expression. With customizable sleeves and engraved options, you can make your
                    EcoBottle truly your own. It's more than a product-it's a movement to shift how we think about everyday consumption.
