Find at least one good use case for each.</li> <li>Style the layout using only external CSS.</li> <li>Use semantic HTML elements when possible.</li> <li>Ensure consistent design, typography, and layout across all pages.</li> <li>Organize files into folders (e.g. <code>/images/</code>) and use lowercase, hyphenated file names (e.g. <code>about-me.html</code>).</li> <li>Your code must pass HTML and CSS validation.</li> </ul> <p>Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have much content yet \u2014 feel free to use placeholder images and fictional examples to help design and structure your CV or portfolio. The focus is on practicing what you have learned so far.</p> <p>You are more than welcome to get creative and add more requirements, but we are focusing on learning the fundamentals, so don't use JavaScript or any external libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap and Tailwind) yet.</p> <p>Tips</p> <ul> <li>The projects will be discussed at the exam. Focus on applying what you've learned to make it easier to explain and showcase your skills. A more interesting project might lead to a more interesting discussion.</li> <li>Plan before you code! Sketch the website (at various screen sizes) and come up with a good layout approach before you start the implementation. It is often easier to start with the mobile layout first (mobile-first design) and only introduce media queries when needed.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"04-first-project/#submission","title":"Submission\ud83d\udce4","text":"<p>This is an individual project.

These allow the browser's built-in form validation to be visually communicated to the user without using JavaScript. For example, an input field outline can turn green when the entered data meets the requirements, and red when it does not, helping users immediately recognize and correct mistakes. This kind of instant visual feedback enhances usability, reduces errors, and makes forms feel more interactive and user-friendly. Watch this short video on styling valid and invalid forms by Kevin Powell, to get some tips on how to do this.

Plan your UI and game flow before implementing it.</li> <li>Start with a minimal viable product (MVP). What is the player doing most of the time? (guessing, reacting, choosing, etc.) Build that first, and then expand around it with UI, polish and extra game mechanics.</li> <li>Big problems needs to be broken down. Analyse the game that you want to make. What systems does it consist of? (UI, game logic, score board, persistence...) Can these systems be broken down further? Can you divide the work so everyone can develop their part without constantly depending on each other?</li> <li>Keep your code modular. Use functions for each piece of logic (e.g., <code>checkAnswer()</code>, <code>updateScore()</code>, <code>resetGame()</code>), so it's easier to understand and explain.</li> <li>Many game ideas require timing or repetition. Use setTimeout() to schedule something once after a delay, and setInterval() to repeat actions at fixed intervals (with can be stopped with clearInterval()).</li> <li>Consider collaborating directly through your GitHub repository, and/or use the Live Share plugin in VS Code to code together in real time.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"10-third-project/#submission","title":"Submission\ud83d\udce4","text":"<p>This is a group project to be completed with your existing SEP group.

That meant that whenever you wanted to make a change to the NavBar, you had to update it on multiple pages - which isn't very efficient. There are a few ways to solve this. A simple approach is to store the HTML for the NavBar in a separate file and fetch it wherever it's needed. Try that using the code below.</p> Tip <ul> <li>The <code>text</code> method of a <code>Response</code> object reads the entire body as a plain string, regardless of whether the content is plain text, HTML, or any other text-based format.</li> </ul> index.htmlnav.htmlstyles.css <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Reusing HTML!&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"solution.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- Write this script! --&gt;\n        &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"navContainer\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"index.html\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"services.html\"&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"about.html\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"contact.html\"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>nav {\n    font-family: sans-serif;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    background: #2196f3;\n}\n\nnav ul {\n    padding: 0px;\n    display: flex;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    justify-content: center;\n    list-style: none;\n}\n\nnav a {\n    text-decoration: none;\n    color: white;\n    padding: 1rem;\n    display: block;\n}\n\nnav a:hover {\n    background: #1976d275;\n}\n\nnav a.active {\n    background: #1976d2;\n}\n</code></pre> Solution <pre><code>fetch(\"nav.html\")\n    .then(response =&gt; response.text())\n    .then(html =&gt; {\n        const container = document.querySelector(\"#navContainer\")\n        container.innerHTML = html\n    })\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"11-fetching-data/#highlighting-the-active-page","title":"Highlighting The Active Page","text":"<p>When we reused the same NavBar HTML across multiple pages, all links look the same.

Feel free to share it in the comments below </p> Tip <ul> <li>The documentation for this API can feel a bit overwhelming. Focus on retrieving some simple data first!</li> <li>Notice that the <code>API URL</code> is automatically generated as you configure the request in the Open-Meteo documentation.</li> <li>Start by logging the parsed object to the console. This gives you a neat, collapsible view of all the properties you received.</li> <li>As an example request, this fetches the current temperature for horsens: <code>https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=55.8607&amp;longitude=9.8503&amp;current=temperature_2m</code>.</li> </ul> Example Solution <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Horsens Weather&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;style&gt;\n            body {\n                display: flex;\n                font-family: \"Segoe UI\", sans-serif;\n                background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #87ceeb, #f0f8ff);\n                justify-content: center;\n                align-items: center;\n                height: 100dvh;\n                margin: 0;\n            }\n\n            .weather-card {\n                background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);\n                padding: 2rem 3rem;\n                border-radius: 1rem;\n                box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n                text-align: center;\n            }\n\n            h1 {\n                margin-bottom: 1rem;\n                font-size: 2rem;\n                color: #333;\n            }\n\n            p {\n                font-size: 1.5rem;\n                margin: 0.5rem;\n                color: #555;\n            }\n        &lt;/style&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"weather-card\"&gt;\n            &lt;h1&gt;Horsens Weather&lt;/h1&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;Temperature: &lt;span id=\"temperature\"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; \u00b0C&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;Wind: &lt;span id=\"windspeed\"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; km/h&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            const temperatureElement = document.querySelector(\"#temperature\")\n            const windSpeedElement = document.querySelector(\"#windspeed\")\n\n            fetch(\"https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=55.8607&amp;longitude=9.8503&amp;current=temperature_2m,wind_speed_10m\")\n                .then(response =&gt; {\n                    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(\"HTTP error \" + response.status)\n                    return response.json()\n                })\n                .then(data =&gt; {\n                    console.log(data)\n                    temperatureElement.textContent = data.current.temperature_2m\n                    windSpeedElement.textContent = data.current.wind_speed_10m\n                })\n                .catch(error =&gt; {\n                    temperatureEl.textContent = \"Could not fetch weather data.\"\n                    console.error(error)\n                })\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"11-fetching-data/#nice-work","title":"Nice Work!","text":"<p>You have now completed ALL EXERCISES IN THE COURSE!
